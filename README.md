This webpage demonstrates structured mesh code generation from point clouds. The idea: instead of generating raw mesh data, we generate readable code that describes how to build 3D shapes.

## What you can do

### Browse objects
Ten furniture and architectural objects sit in the gallery. Each was generated from point cloud data. Click any object to see its 3D model and the structured code that describes it.

### Explore code-mesh connections
Hover over code lines to highlight corresponding mesh parts. Click mesh parts to jump to the relevant code. This bidirectional mapping shows how abstract code operations connect to concrete geometry.

### Ask about shapes
The Q&A section lets you query shape semantics. The responses are generated by ChatGPT4o, with the generated code input.

## How it works

The demo maintains connections between code blocks and named mesh components. When you hover over a `create_primitive` call for a sofa leg, the system identifies which mesh object represents that leg and highlights it.

Everything runs in the browser using Three.js for rendering. The models are pre-generated GLB files, and the code files contain the structured descriptions that would normally be generated from point clouds.

## Implementation

The JavaScript modules each handle specific concerns:
- `editing.js` manages code display and mesh highlighting
- `understanding.js` handles semantic queries  
- `three-viewer.js` wraps Three.js complexity
- `code.js` handles syntax highlighting

The CSS follows the same modular approach.

## Context

This accompanies the research paper "MeshCoder: LLM-Powered Structured Mesh Code Generation from Point Clouds" by researchers at Shanghai AI Lab, Tsinghua University, and other institutions. The paper describes training language models to generate this structured mesh code from raw point cloud data.

This demo shows the output of that process—generated code and meshes—in an interactive format.

## Running

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Everything is self-contained except CDN dependencies (Three.js, Bulma, Highlight.js). Serve from a web server to avoid CORS issues with model loading.

## Adding objects

To add a new model:
1. Place GLB file in `assets/models/`
2. Add code file to `assets/codes/`
3. Update the model list in `editing.js`
4. Add gallery entry in `index.html`

The system handles loading, parsing, and establishing code-mesh connections.

## What this shows

Structured code serves as an intermediate representation between raw 3D data and human understanding. Point clouds are coordinates. Mesh formats are triangles. But code with meaningful names and clear structure bridges both—readable enough to understand, structured enough to modify, connected enough to geometry that relationships remain clear.

Whether this scales beyond furniture, or whether generated code stays meaningful for complex shapes, remains to be seen. But for these objects, the code-geometry connection feels natural.
